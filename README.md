# File Transfer Application
Use Python and Tkinter to build a desktop application with both gui and database functionality.

Written and tested in Python 3.5.2

## Tech Academy Python Drill
This application was built as part of the Python curriculum for the Tech Academy.

The idea was to write simple logic that then evolved in complexity and eventually
adding a gui and interaction with a database while completing the task of transferring
specific files from one location to another within a computer.

### 1. Datetime Drill
  Your company has opened two new branches in New York City and London. Write a simple
	program that checks if the branches are open based on the current time at the heaqquarters
	in Portland.

### 2. Shutil Drill
  Your employer has asked that you write a program to move all .txt files from one folder
	to another with the click of a button. 

### 3. Daily File Transfer Drill
  Your company has asked that you add logic to your shutil application that finds all .txt
	files that were modified in the last 24 hours, and then only sends those from one folder to 
	another.

### 4. Daily File GUI Drill
  Add a UI for the daily file transfer script that allows the user to browse and choose which
	specific folders will act as a source and final destination. Also include functionality that
	lets the user know the actions were completed successfully.

### 5. Daily File Database Drill
  Add database functionality to your application that tracks whenever the application is run.
	Access the database to find the time and date of the most recent transfer and display it in
	the gui.
