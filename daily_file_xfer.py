""" Python Workplace Simulation

Written/Tested in Python 3.5.2

Task: Your company has asked you to create a scripting program that
copies all new/recently edited .txt files written each day into another
folder so that your script can have them transferred to the home office at
a specific daily time. The script must be able to tell if the files
have been modified in the last 24 hours and only transfer those.
